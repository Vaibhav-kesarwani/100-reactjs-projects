## 🧰 Tech Stack

Each project in this repository is crafted using modern, lightweight tools and libraries to help you build real-world, production-grade React applications. Here's what powers them:

- ⚛️ **React.js (18+)** – The heart of every project. We use functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.), and modern patterns to manage state and UI logic.

- 🛠️ **Vite / CRA (Create React App)** – Most projects are scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for lightning-fast development and hot module replacement. Some may use CRA as well.

- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** *(optional)* – Utility-first CSS framework used in many projects for rapid, responsive, and consistent UI styling.

- 🎞 **Framer Motion** *(in UI/UX projects)* – For delightful animations and smooth UI transitions without the complexity of traditional CSS keyframes.

- 🧩 **Lucide React / Heroicons** – Modern, open-source SVG icon libraries used to enhance UI with accessible and scalable icons.

- 🌐 **Fetch API / Axios** – For making HTTP requests and handling API integration in real-world applications like weather apps, quote generators, etc.

- 💾 **LocalStorage / SessionStorage** – To persist data across sessions, for apps like to-do lists, settings managers, and form savers.

- 🧠 **Custom Hooks** – Encapsulating reusable logic like theme toggles, fetch utilities, debounced inputs, clipboard handling, etc.

- 📦 **Modular Folder Structure** – Each project follows a clean file structure:

- 🧪 **ESLint + Prettier** *(recommended)* – For writing consistent, error-free code with enforced code standards.

- 🔍 **DevTools & Debugging** – We encourage use of React DevTools, browser storage inspectors, and custom logs to better understand app behavior.

---

> 🔧 **Bonus:** Many projects are `minimal` and `framework-free` to keep the learning curve low, but you'll find several `enhanced versions` using popular `libraries` as optional upgrades.
