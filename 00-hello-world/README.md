# Hello World React App

This is a barebones **Hello World** application built with ReactJS. It serves as a minimal example to demonstrate a basic React setup and rendering.

## Local Setup

Follow these steps to get the **Hello World** React app running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js**: This project uses Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vaibhav-kesarwani/50-reactjs-projects.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    Change into the newly cloned project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 50-reactjs-projects/00-hello-world
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Once inside the project directory, install the necessary Node.js packages by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the required libraries.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173/`. If it doesn't open automatically, you can navigate to that URL manually.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you'll see a simple webpage displaying "Hello, World!" or similar text, demonstrating that your React application is successfully compiled and served.

You can modify the `src/App.js` (or similar main component file) to see your changes reflected live in the browser, thanks to React's hot-reloading feature.

Feel free to explore the `src` folder to understand the basic file structure of a React application.
